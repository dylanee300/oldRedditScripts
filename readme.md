hi there :wave: these python scripts are some cool scripts i made for <a>old.reddit.com</a>.. i'm not very familer with python as i dont use it much so i dont know how to make this work with the newer versions. feel free to check these scripts out and use them. the find post with most karma isnt working properly and i cant figure out why so its empty for now..

setting up:
- download vscode if you havent already
- download the python extension in vscode
- run the cmd `pip install requests beautifulsoup4` in the terminal 
- enjoy!
